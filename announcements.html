      <p class="mentor-paragraph">In May 2024, I was lucky enough to have been picked as a Picture Book Rising Stars Mentee! The PB Rising Stars Mentorship program started in 2022 and was created and run by Kailei Pew and Ebony Lynn Mudd. This immersive experience allowed me to grow professionally through workshops, critiques, and community building. It has truly been a life-changing experience and has brought me that much closer to achieving my writing and publishing goals! My mentor, Sara Holly Ackerman provided me with feedback, guidance, and encouragement every step of the way. Her expertise as an author was instrumental in my growth throughout the mentorship. I feel so grateful to have had her by my side!</p>
