      <p class="about-paragraph">Welcome to my site…</p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">All Things Snazzy, where I share my passion for cake design, teaching, writing, illustration, art, children’s picture books, food, and travel!</p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, with an East Indian-East African heritage. Shortly after getting married, we began a new adventure in Dubai! It was here that I unlocked my artistic soul and fell in love with the art of cake design. After training at the Bonnie Gordon School of Cake Design during our summers in Toronto, I started my own cake business in Dubai, specializing in 3D custom cakes. This quickly led to teaching cake art to both adults and kids, where I found my love of teaching. I even founded the first kids' cooking camp in Dubai. Click <a href="dubai.html">HERE</a> to read a copy of the article from TimeOutDubai to learn more.</p> 
      <p class="about-paragraph">After leaving Dubai, we moved to Orange County, California, where I competed in local cake competitions and won three times! But my heart still pulled me toward teaching. Once we moved to Los Angeles, I finally began what I was meant to do – teach! I am currently an Early Childhood Educator, teaching kids aged 3-5 years. As I find joy in teaching children, I also find myself drawn to reading and writing for them. I now practice writing and illustrating for kids and am a member of SCBWI and 12x12 Challenge, where I’m learning and perfecting my craft. My students give me inspiration to write humorous, heartfelt stories, and I hope to entertain them one day with my published work…and so my journey continues…</p>
